## Brief

This was a one-week project to create a CRUD application with a Django backend serving a React fronten with a focus on applying skills learned in previous weeks of the bootcamp. The deliverables included:
- User stories
- Wireframing
- Planning RESTful routes
- Planning data architecture
- Creating a CRUD site using REACT with an Django backend and a PostgreSQL database.
- Deploying the above site

## Planning

Once the concept of the application had been conceived I started with the user story in order to best consider the needs, expectations and experience of various end users. This helped to fully form the concept in order to be able to consider next steps. 

Following this I set about creating a wireframe informed by my user stories. I chose to create only a mobile base model for my wireframe for the following reasons:
- Adhering to a mobile first methodology and the advantages that this brings
- By it's nature I would forsee this site being used by the vast majority of users on a mobile device
- The concept I had in mind required a clean and minimalist layout with few graphics or additional decorative styles and therefore will probably require very little addaptation to scale to larger screens as long as it is build with responsiveness in mind.

I used the wireframe and the user stories to create my restful routing table and further consider the type of data interactions what would be required in each section of the app. 

With all of the above in place and a little research into options for calendar views and todo items with dates I was able to create my ERD to plan out my data relationships and the tables the project would require.

## Build / Code Process

Starting with the back end I created my Django project and built out the apps required for it's Minimum Viable Product(MVP).  As this was my first solo Django project I took it all fairly slowly and carefully testing frequently to avoid having to spend lots of time debugging issues down the line. 

One of the first things that struck me in building out apps is the incredible power of building utils and applying them with decorators in Django. While building the views it makes the code so much more efficient and clean and really enabled me to concentrate on the pure logic of my apps features and interactions. It's also so much easier to read. The first instance of this that I implemented was for exception handling as we had been shown this in our lectures. 

Reading through documentation I was also excited about ...........

## Challenges

As always getting to grips with a new technology (in this instance Django) makes for slow going but although this is a challenge it's a very helpful one as I feel I gain a far better understanding of the tools by using them than I do from lectures and reading alone.
